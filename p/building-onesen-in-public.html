  <p><img src="/img/2024-01-01-building-onesen-in-public.png" alt="A unique visual representation of the &#39;OneSen&#39; note-taking app" title="A unique visual representation of the 'OneSen' note-taking app"></p><p>It‚Äôs been a while since I posted on my blog. Almost two years, to be precise. I was focusing my energy on other parts of my life, and, to be honest, I never got back into publishing regular blog posts after falling off the wagon in 2017. But now I am back, and I intend to publish more often.</p><h2>Building OneSen</h2><p>Last week, I started a new side project. It‚Äôs called OneSen, and currently, it‚Äôs a text field you can use to store your daily notes. In the future, I envision it to be a note-taking app focusing on daily notes (much like micro-blogging) and simplicity. I also have ideas to add the capabilities of LLMs to enrich the experience and get insights into your notes. The alpha version, without a design, text, or explanations, can be found at <a href="https://onesen.app">https://onesen.app</a>. But it works üòâ</p><h2>Build in public</h2><p>My current plan is to build this app in public. I like the idea of (radical) transparency, which is present when being open about everything happening. I like to teach others what works for me and what doesn‚Äôt. I like to inspire others to build something on their own, make their work more public, or share more. We can all benefit from the experiences others have already had.</p><h2>The idea</h2><p>To be transparent, I have to give credit where credit is due. The idea for OneSen came from Dainius, who mentioned that he‚Äôd like a straightforward interface to take notes and have them stored daily, much like a physical notebook with its pages dedicated to a specific date.</p><p>I let the idea sit, and because I thought about it more over time, I decided to act on it. I kept the notebook analogy since the concept closely relates to physical notebooks. Currently, each notebook contains pages, one page for each day. A user can only change the current day, and the system saves changes automatically when the text changes. It‚Äôs as easy as possible. Go to your notebook, write something, and leave.</p><h2>The MVP</h2><p>My current plan for the MVP is to add a design, make it possible to view past dates and rename notebooks. Those changes should be enough to make it usable and see if people want something like this. </p><h2>The long term vision</h2><p>OneSen could go in many directions. One idea I had was the ‚ÄúOne second a day‚Äù video app for writing. Write something daily and combine it per week, month, or year.</p><p>Another idea was to add LLM capabilities, analyze notes, and gather insights using AI. This feature could be interesting for people writing morning pages or journals.</p><p>I am also thinking about encrypting notes on the client, adding security that almost no other note-taking app has. The drawback would be that working with notes would need to happen on the client since even searching would not be possible with encrypted notes.</p>
