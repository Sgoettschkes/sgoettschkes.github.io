<h2>What I'm doing now</h2>

<p>I'm still in Vienna, working on a ton of different things.
I recently started working with the blossom team and doing freelancing work beside that.
I spend most of my time on these things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Making the blossom application better</li>
    <li>Learning a ton of Python and Dart</li>
    <li>Learning a lot about growth at a startup</li>
    <li>Diving deep into the Google Cloud Platform</li>
    <li>Writing and talking about Vagrant/Ansible</li>
    <li>Organizing the Dart Usergroup and getting involved in WeAreDevelopers</li>
    <li>Running and Body Weight Exercise</li>
    <li>Going to hardcore punk shows and running tbalive, a small distro</li>
    <li>Meditating</li>
</ul>
