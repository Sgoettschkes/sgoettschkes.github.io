Since over 60 days I am meditating every day for 15 minutes. Reflecting on what has changed, I was amazed to learn how much calmer I am now than I was before I started. It feels like there is some (small) buffer between my feelings and my thinking, making it possible to watch the feelings unfold from the distance without being blown away by them.

## Thinking about empathy

I am meditating using Headspace. They have different series focusing on one theme. I've "worked" through the Foundation, Happiness and empathy and am now a few days into Anxiety. The series which helped me the most up until now is empathy, simply because having empathy for others not only makes live a lot easier, it also helped me being more ok with myself.

I guess that people have different ideas on empathy and how it can help you. Even before I started, I was baffled at how much energy people put into being angry/mad/sad about other people or experiences they made. Let me make a simple example: You are driving down the road and another driver is doing something wrong/stupid. Many people will get angry, maybe honk or yell. Depending on the person and what happened, they may tell others what happened. It's funny because the only thing that happens now is that it hurts you. The other driver is already gone and you won't change anything by ranting about it.

Now, let's add some empathy: Instead of getting angry, why not assume the other driver simply made a mistake. Maybe he was stressed out or he is just not good at driving. Maybe he just didn't see you or made some mistake he noticed and won't do again. To be clear: I don't talk about getting angry and then trying to calm down with such arguments. I am talking about starting with these arguments as a mind set.

This doesn't mean that you should other people run over you, always assuming the best. If there would have been an accident and it was that persons fault, of course I would get the insurance involved or call the police or whatever needed. But, then again, I most likely would not jump out of my car, screaming at the other person what an idiot he is.

## Taking a step back

Think about this: We all make mistakes. We all do stupid things. Most of the time, we don't do them because we want to hurt somebody else.
