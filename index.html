    <p>Setting up new projects is always exciting, but if you have done it a few times, it’s getting old quick.

There is nothing new in here and if you are a seasoned Clojure developer, you might not learn much. If you are just starting out or have some work done in Clojure but need a working setup or some input on your current setup, you are at the right place.</p>

I realize that coding puzzles and dojos and katas are not real world applications and one might miss certain things like performance or running an application in production. But they are small enough to provide fast feedback and to not hit a big wall. Even if I am not able to solve one, I can always skip that and keep going with another puzzle.</p>

    <p>When I am talking about Vagrant at usergroups and conferences, one thing I always mention is that shared folders are slow, especially with Virtualbox. While it’s true for reading to some extend, the biggest bottleneck I experience is writing to the shared folder. This happens a lot with cache and logs in development mode when you use e.g. symfony2. These folders live inside the project dir and depending on your project structure you might not be able to redirect them to some folder inside the vm.</p>

This can be done by doing a <code class="inline">GET</code> request and passing the url to your sitemap as a parameter. Easy as pie, right?</p>

    <p>As you might know by now, I like static side generators. They combine the flexibility of a templating system with the easy deployment of static pages. Creating pages feels like working in a programming language and deploying the page in the end is as easy as putting some html files on an ftp (which you shouldn’t do, of course). There is no need for a complicated setup or deployment process because it’s just some HTML served from nginx (or any other webserver). You can put the files on Amazon S3, your own host or github pages. And as it’s only static files being served, performance is as good as it gets.</p>
